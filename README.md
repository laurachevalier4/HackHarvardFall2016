Our awesome lending and borrowing webapp

## TODO:
* Borrowing functionality
  * Set borrower -- distinguish borrowed (past) to current borrow
  * Lent item optionally refreshes automatically after returned
  * List currently borrowed items in search but grayed out and allow filter
  * In user profile, distinguish between lending (borrowed) and lending (not yet borrowed)
* Time limits
* Trustworthy score / reviews
* Implement in-app messaging
* Notifications

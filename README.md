# HackHarvardFall2016
Our awesome lending and borrowing webapp

## TODO:
* Borrowing functionality
  * Return functionality
  * Lent item optionally refreshes automatically after returned
  * Option to refresh manually
* Listing descriptions
* Edit [available] listings
* Track listing history or number of borrows
* Time limits
* Trustworthy score / reviews
* Implement in-app messaging
* Notifications
* Instead of having it be a neighborhood-wide thing, market to apartment buildings with receptions that can handle the exchange
  * For a small one-time fee, join the building-wide network of sharing?
